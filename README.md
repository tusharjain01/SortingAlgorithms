## Getting Started ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the another repositry related to *Data Structures and Algorithms* . Here I will be learning different types for algorithms for sorting. I hope you like it .

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Table of Content:-
| S.no | Algorithms | Time Complexity |
| :--- | ---------- | :-------------: |
| 1 | Bubble Sort | O(n^2) |
| 2 | Selection Sort | O(n^2) |
| 3 | Insertion Sort | O(n^2) |
| 4 | Merge Sort (preq:- `mergetwosortedarray.java` ) | O(nlog(n)) |
| 5 | Quick Sort (preq:- `paritioningarray.java` ) | O(nlog(n)) |
