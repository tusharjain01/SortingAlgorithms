<h1 align = "center"> SORTING ALGORITHMS </h1>
## Getting Started ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the another repositry related to *Data Structures and Algorithms* . Here I will be learning different types for algorithms for sorting. I hope you like it .

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

### *Currently two program files have been added for Bubble Sort and Selection Sort, both of them being of time complexity O(n^2). Further will upload more optimised sorting algorithms.*
#### *Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.*
- `src\bubbleSort.java`
- `src\selectionSort.java`

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
