## Getting Started ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the another repositry related to *Data Structures and Algorithms* . Here I will be learning different types for algorithms for sorting. I hope you like it .

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Table of Content:-
| S.no | Algorithms | Time Complexity |
| :--- | ---------- | :-------------: |
| 1 | Bubble Sort | O(n^2) |
| 2 | Selection Sort | O(n^2) |
| 3 | Insertion Sort | )(n^2) |
| 4 | Merge Sort (preq:-merge two sorted array) | O(nlog(n)) |
| 5 | Quick Sort (paritioning the array) | O(nlog(n)) |

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
